Aleksandra Los,Organizer,DevOps Not Dead,,"Most events feel like everyone is waiting for permission to relax. A playful RPG setting gives people that permission right away. It melts the formal vibe, makes conversations easier to start, and turns strangers into party members instead of awkward hallway passers. The logistics become smoother because the mood is warmer, the crowd is looser, and people are simply more willing to engage.",DnD London,Yes,Aleksandra Los DnD.png
Daniel Afonso,Senior Developer Advocate,PagerDuty,,"Every time someone claims DevOps is over, another team somewhere is accidentally summoning a production-level dragon because their build scrolls weren’t updated. DevOps is the art of keeping the kingdom running without the castle catching fire. As long as apps exist, someone has to tame the beasts behind the curtain.",DnD London,Yes,Daniel Afonso DnD.png
Mark Pawlikowski,Organizer,DevOps Not Dead,,"You’ve got your tanky SREs, your glass-cannon developers, your support clerics, and that one QA wizard who knows way too much about your doomed legacy systems. Putting everyone in an actual fantasy setting just completes the metaphor we’ve all been living anyway.",DnD London,Yes,Mark Pawlikowski DnD.png
Miko Pawlikowski,Tech Author,Hockeystick.show,,"Nothing heals deployment trauma like framing it as a cursed artifact misbehaving. Observability becomes scrying. CI jobs become enchanted runes. Outages become boss fights. Suddenly, the hard stuff feels like an adventure, not punishment. And that’s exactly why DevOps isn’t dead at all. It just needs a better questline.",DnD London,Yes,Miko Pawlikowski DnD.png
